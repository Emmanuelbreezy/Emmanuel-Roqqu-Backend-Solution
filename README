## 📌 Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (v18 or later recommended)
- **npm** (comes with Node.js)
- **SQLite3** (for local database testing)

cd Emmanuel-Roqqu-Backend-Solution
```

### Install Dependencies

## 🛠️ Database Setup

This project uses **TypeORM** with SQLite. To set up the database:

### 1️⃣ Run Migrations

```sh
npm run db:migrate
```

This will create the necessary tables in the SQLite database.

### (Optional) Drop Database

To completely reset the database:

```sh
npm run db:drop
```

Create a `.env` file in the root directory and configure the following:

```sh
PORT=8000
NODE_ENV=development

```

## 🚀 Running the Server

To start the development server:

```sh
npm run dev
```

This will run the server using `ts-node-dev` for hot-reloading.

For production, build and start the server:

```sh
npm run build
npm run start
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:8000` (or your configured port).

npm run test:unit
```

### Run API Tests Only

```sh
npm run test:api
```

### Watch Mode (Auto-run on changes)

```sh
npm run test:watch
```

## 📌 Notes for the Interviewer
